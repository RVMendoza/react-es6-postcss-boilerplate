# react-es6-postcss-boilerplate
"Good God, just let me do stuff please."  This has react, ES6, and a couple PostCSS plugins to get you started.

Based on https://github.com/DavidWells/PostCSS-tutorial which is based on https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app.


I will explain better later, but basically fork this, `npm install` and then `npm start`.

PostCSS Plugins to get you started:
- postcss-custom-properties
- postcss-nested
