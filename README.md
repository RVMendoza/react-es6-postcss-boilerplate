# react-es6-postcss-boilerplate
"Good God, just let me do stuff please."  

This has react, ES6, and a couple PostCSS plugins to get you started.

Based on [PostCSS-tutorial](https://github.com/DavidWells/PostCSS-tutorial) which is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


I will explain better later, but basically fork this, `npm install` and then `npm start`.

PostCSS Plugins to get you started:
- [postcss-custom-properties](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-properties)
- [postcss-nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested)
- [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import)
  - This plugin can consume local files, node modules or web_modules.
- [css-modularscale](https://github.com/VinSpee/css-modularscale)
  - For consistent spacing
