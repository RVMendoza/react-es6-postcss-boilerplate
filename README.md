"Good God, just let me do stuff please."  

This has react, ES6, and a several PostCSS plugins that I tend to use to get started.

Based on [PostCSS-tutorial](https://github.com/DavidWells/PostCSS-tutorial) which is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I will explain better later, but basically fork this, `npm install` and then `npm start`.

# PostCSS Plugins to get you started:
- [postcss-custom-properties](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-properties)
