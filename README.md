I made this becuase as a front-end dev, setting up projects stress me tf out.

I couldn't find any simple tutorials and when I did find some, they made too many logic jumps that assumed my knowledge and I got lost by step 7.

This is geared towards front-end folks that just want to start doing hoodrat things with their hoodrat friends online.

This has react, ES6, and a several PostCSS plugins that I tend to use to get started.

Based on [PostCSS-tutorial](https://github.com/DavidWells/PostCSS-tutorial) which is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I will explain better later, but basically fork this, `npm install` and then `npm start`.
