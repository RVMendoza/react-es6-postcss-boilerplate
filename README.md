I made this becuase as a front-end dev, setting up projects stress me tf out.

I couldn't find any simple tutorials and when I did find some, they made too many logic jumps that assumed knowledge I didn't have. I didn't even know what I didn't know so I got lost by step 7.

This is geared towards front-end folks that just want to start doing hoodrat things with their hoodrat friends online.

This has react, ES6, and a several PostCSS plugins that I tend to use to get started.

Based on [PostCSS-tutorial](https://github.com/DavidWells/PostCSS-tutorial) which is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I will explain better later, but basically fork this, `npm install` and then `npm start`.

# PostCSS Plugins to get you started:
- [postcss-custom-properties](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-properties)
- [postcss-nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested)
- [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import)
  - This plugin can consume local files, node modules or web_modules.
  
  # Other Plugins
- [react-router v3](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
  - So you can use urls and such. [react v3 tutorial](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-tutorial/tree/master/lessons/02-rendering-a-route)
  - Version 4 of react-react router came out in April 2017, but I don't quite understand it, so I'm using v3 because the tutorial is easier to follow.
- [css-modularscale](https://github.com/VinSpee/css-modularscale)
  - For consistent spacing and size.
- [reset-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reset-css)
  - Resets the CSS
- [suitcss](https://github.com/suitcss/suit)
  - Utility components
- [suitcss-utils-space](https://github.com/VinSpee/suitcss-utils-space)
